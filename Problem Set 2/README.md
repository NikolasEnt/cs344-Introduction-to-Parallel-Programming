# Problem Set 2

Blurring an image with CUDA by a convolution (a kind of gaussian blur with a square filter kernel convolution).

## How to use
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./HW2 path/to/the/input/image
```

The resulting image is outputted in the build directory.

## Sample output

Input image:

![Original image](cinque_terre_small.jpg)

Output image:

![Output blurred image](HW2_output.png)
